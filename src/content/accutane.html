<h2>What Is Accutane?</h2>
<p>
  Isotretinoin is a prescription medication used to treat severe nodular acne
  that has not responded to other treatments, including antibiotics. It is taken
  by mouth in two divided doses with food. The dose is based on your body
  weight, and a typical course of treatment lasts about 4 to 5 months or longer
  depending on your response to treatment.
