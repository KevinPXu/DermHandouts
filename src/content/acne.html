<h2>What Is Acne?</h2>
<p>
  Acne is a common skin condition that affects the hair follicles and oil glands
  in your skin. It happens when pores become clogged with oil, dead skin cells,
  and bacteria. Acne is <strong>NOT</strong> caused by poor hygiene or dirty skin!
</p>

<h2>What Causes Acne?</h2>
<p>Acne develops from four main factors working together:</p>
<ol class="cause-list">
  <li>Excess oil production in your skin</li>
  <li>Clogged pores from dead skin cells</li>
  <li>Bacteria (called C. acnes) that live on the skin</li>
  <li>Inflammation (redness and swelling)</li>
</ol>
<p class="note">** Hormones, genetics, and certain medications can make acne worse.</p>

<h2>Skincare Habits</h2>
<div class="numbered-grid">

  <div class="numbered-card">
    <span class="card-num">1</span>
    <h3>Wash your face gently, twice daily</h3>
    <p>
      Use a fragrance-free cleanser. Avoid harsh scrubs, astringents, or
      exfoliating washes, as these can irritate your skin and worsen acne.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="numbered-card">
    <span class="card-num">2</span>
    <h3>Use a moisturizer</h3>
    <p>
      A fragrance-free, non-comedogenic (won't clog pores) moisturizer helps
      reduce irritation from acne medications. Apply before and/or after topical
      medications (sandwich method) to minimize dryness.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="numbered-card">
    <span class="card-num">3</span>
    <h3>Choose the right makeup</h3>
    <p>Look for products labeled "non-comedogenic," "oil-free," or "won't clog pores."</p>
    <p>Clean brushes and makeup utensils regularly as bacteria and oils accumulate on these items.</p>
    <p>Remove makeup thoroughly before bed as sleeping in makeup can clog pores and worsen acne.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="numbered-card">
    <span class="card-num">4</span>
    <h3>Apply sunscreen daily</h3>
    <p>
      Use a broad-spectrum SPF 30 or higher, especially if you have dark spots
      from acne. Sun exposure can darken these spots and make them last longer.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="numbered-card">
    <span class="card-num">5</span>
    <h3>Avoid touching your face</h3>
    <p>Hands transfer bacteria and oils to facial skin throughout the day.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="numbered-card numbered-card-accent">
    <span class="card-num">!</span>
    <h3>Don't pick, pop, or squeeze!!</h3>
    <p>Picking at acne can cause scarring, infection, and worsen dark spots!</p>

<h2>Diet Considerations</h2>
<p class="section-intro">
  Research on diet and acne is still evolving, but some studies suggest:
</p>
<div class="numbered-grid">

  <div class="numbered-card">
    <span class="card-num">1</span>
    <h3>Consider a low-glycemic diet</h3>
    <p>
      Foods that cause rapid spikes in blood sugar (white bread, sugary drinks,
      candy, white rice, pastries) may worsen acne. High glycemic foods increase
      insulin and IGF-1 levels, which stimulate oil production and inflammation.
      Choosing whole grains, vegetables, and lean proteins may help.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="numbered-card">
    <span class="card-num">2</span>
    <h3>Dairy may play a role</h3>
    <p>
      Studies show an association between milk consumption and acne. If you
      notice a connection, consider reducing dairy intake.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="numbered-card">
    <span class="card-num">3</span>
    <h3>Omega-3 fatty acids may help</h3>
    <p>
      Foods rich in omega-3s (salmon, sardines, walnuts, flaxseed) have
      anti-inflammatory properties that may benefit skin health.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="numbered-card">
    <span class="card-num">4</span>
    <h3>Chocolate</h3>
    <p>
      Evidence is mixed; cocoa or high-sugar formulations may worsen acne in
      some people.
    </p>

<h2>Lifestyle Factors</h2>
<div class="numbered-grid">

  <div class="numbered-card">
    <span class="card-num">1</span>
    <h3>Get regular exercise</h3>
    <p>
      Studies show that regular physical activity may indirectly improve acne
      through metabolic and stress-related effects.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="numbered-card">
    <span class="card-num">2</span>
    <h3>Limit prolonged sitting</h3>
    <p>
      Sedentary behavior has been associated with acne in some observational
      studies, though causation is unclear.

  </div>

  <div class="numbered-card">
    <span class="card-num">3</span>
    <h3>Prioritize sleep</h3>
    <p>
      Going to bed late and poor sleep quality have been linked to acne. Aim for
      consistent sleep.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="numbered-card">
    <span class="card-num">4</span>
    <h3>Change/wash pillowcases regularly</h3>
    <p>Oils, bacteria, and dead skin cells accumulate on pillowcases.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="numbered-card">
    <span class="card-num">5</span>
    <h3>Clean your phone screen, hats, and glasses</h3>
    <p>
      Objects that touch your face frequently can transfer bacteria and oils.

        Prescription and OTC
      </td>
      <td>
        Kills acne-causing bacteria (C. acnes) by releasing oxygen radicals;
        unclogs pores (comedolytic); prevents antibiotic resistance when used
        with antibiotics; no bacterial resistance develops to benzoyl peroxide
      </td>
      <td>
        Apply to wet skin once or twice daily. Massage gently for 1–2 minutes,
        then rinse thoroughly. AVOID EYES. Can be used in the morning if using
        tretinoin at night.
      </td>
      <td>
        Expect initial dryness and redness – improves with continued use. Will
        bleach towels, pillowcases, and clothing. RINSE THOROUGHLY. If severe
        irritation occurs, reduce frequency or discontinue. DO NOT apply at the
        same time as standard tretinoin.

        Reduces acne-causing bacteria, decreases inflammation; effective for
        inflammatory acne (red bumps and pimples)
      </td>
      <td>
        Wash and dry face completely before applying. Apply a thin film to the
        entire affected area once or twice daily.

        OTC (0.1%); Prescription (0.3%)<br>
        <em>Cornerstone of acne treatment—Considered first-line!</em>
      </td>
      <td>
        Unclogs pores and prevents new comedones (comedolytic), reduces
        inflammation; speeds up skin cell turnover to clear existing acne;
        improves dark spots from acne (postinflammatory hyperpigmentation).
        Tretinoin provides significant long-term benefits beyond acne treatment,
        including restoration of collagen synthesis, improvement in photoaging,
        pigmentation from scarring, and maintenance of skin health.
      </td>
      <td>
        Wash face with a gentle cleanser and pat dry completely. Wait 20–30
        minutes after washing before applying (skin should be completely dry).
        Apply a pea-sized amount to the ENTIRE face once daily at bedtime—not
        just on pimples. Spread in a thin layer, avoiding eyes, mouth, corners
        of nose, and lips. Start slowly: use every 2–3 nights for the first 2
        weeks, then increase to every other night, then nightly as tolerated.
        Apply moisturizer BEFORE/AFTER/BOTH (Sandwich method). Wait 5–10 minutes.
      </td>
      <td>
        Expect dryness, peeling, redness, and stinging—normal and usually peaks
        at 2 weeks, then improves. "Purging" may occur: acne may temporarily
        worsen for 4–6 weeks as hidden pimples come to the surface—this is NOT
        a reason to stop. Increases sun sensitivity—wear SPF 30+ sunscreen
        daily! Tretinoin breaks down in sunlight (photolabile)—apply only at
        night. DO NOT apply at the same time as benzoyl peroxide (inactivates
        standard tretinoin)—use BP in the morning, tretinoin at night. Avoid
        during pregnancy due to potential teratogenic risk.
