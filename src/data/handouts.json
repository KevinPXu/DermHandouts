      "content": "<h2>What Is Acne?</h2><p>Acne is a common skin condition that affects the hair follicles and oil glands in your skin. It happens when pores become clogged with oil, dead skin cells, and bacteria. Acne is <strong>NOT</strong> caused by poor hygiene or dirty skin!</p><h2>What Causes Acne?</h2><p>Acne develops from four main factors working together:</p><ul><li>Excess oil production in your skin</li><li>Clogged pores from dead skin cells</li><li>Bacteria (called C. acnes) that live on the skin</li><li>Inflammation (redness and swelling)</li></ul><p>Hormones, genetics, and certain medications can make acne worse.</p><h2>Skincare Habits</h2><ul><li><strong>Wash your face gently, twice daily</strong> – Use a fragrance-free cleanser. Avoid harsh scrubs, astringents, or exfoliating washes, as these can irritate your skin and worsen acne.</li><li><strong>Use a moisturizer</strong> – A fragrance-free, non-comedogenic (won't clog pores) moisturizer helps reduce irritation from acne medications. Apply before and/or after topical medications (sandwich method) to minimize dryness.</li><li><strong>Choose the right makeup</strong> – Look for products labeled \"non-comedogenic,\" \"oil-free,\" or \"won't clog pores.\"</li><li><strong>Clean brushes and makeup utensils regularly</strong> – Bacteria and oils accumulate on these items.</li><li><strong>Remove makeup thoroughly before bed</strong> – Sleeping in makeup can clog pores and worsen acne.</li><li><strong>Apply sunscreen daily</strong> – Use a broad-spectrum SPF 30 or higher, especially if you have dark spots from acne. Sun exposure can darken these spots and make them last longer.</li><li><strong>Avoid touching your face</strong> – Hands transfer bacteria and oils to facial skin throughout the day.</li><li><strong>Don't pick, pop, or squeeze</strong> – Picking at acne can cause scarring, infection, and worsen dark spots!</li></ul><h2>Diet Considerations</h2><p>Research on diet and acne is still evolving, but some studies suggest:</p><ul><li><strong>Consider a low-glycemic diet</strong> – Foods that cause rapid spikes in blood sugar (white bread, sugary drinks, candy, white rice, pastries) may worsen acne. High glycemic foods increase insulin and IGF-1 levels, which stimulate oil production and inflammation. Choosing whole grains, vegetables, and lean proteins may help.</li><li><strong>Dairy may play a role</strong> – Studies show an association between milk consumption and acne. If you notice a connection, consider reducing dairy intake.</li><li><strong>Omega-3 fatty acids may help</strong> – Foods rich in omega-3s (salmon, sardines, walnuts, flaxseed) have anti-inflammatory properties that may benefit skin health.</li><li><strong>Chocolate</strong> – Evidence is mixed; cocoa or high-sugar formulations may worsen acne in some people.</li></ul><h2>Lifestyle Factors</h2><ul><li><strong>Get regular exercise</strong> – Studies show that regular physical activity may indirectly improve acne through metabolic and stress-related effects.</li><li><strong>Limit prolonged sitting</strong> – Sedentary behavior has been associated with acne in some observational studies, though causation is unclear.</li><li><strong>Prioritize sleep</strong> – Going to bed late and poor sleep quality have been linked to acne. Aim for consistent sleep.</li><li><strong>Change/wash pillowcases regularly</strong> – Oils, bacteria, and dead skin cells accumulate on pillowcases.</li><li><strong>Clean your phone screen, hats, and glasses</strong> – Objects that touch your face frequently can transfer bacteria and oils.</li><li><strong>Manage stress</strong> – Stress can worsen acne through hormonal changes.</li></ul><div class=\"callout\"><h2>Important Reminders – Understanding Your Treatment!</h2><ul><li>Results take time – be consistent with your habits for at least 2–3 months before evaluating improvement.</li><li>Everyone's skin is different – what works for one person may not work for another.</li><li>Use sunscreen daily (SPF 30+)</li><li><strong>ALWAYS SPOT TEST NEW PRODUCTS!</strong> Avoid using multiple new products at once!</li><li><strong>DO NOT PICK AT ACNE! AVOID TOUCHING FACE!</strong></li></ul></div><h2>Product Guide</h2><table class=\"product-table\"><thead><tr><th>Product</th><th>Benefits</th><th>How to use</th><th>Cautions</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>BENZOYL PEROXIDE WASH</strong> (2.5–10%)<br>Prescription and OTC</td><td>Kills acne-causing bacteria (C. acnes) by releasing oxygen radicals; unclogs pores (comedolytic); prevents antibiotic resistance when used with antibiotics; no bacterial resistance develops to benzoyl peroxide</td><td>Apply to wet skin once or twice daily. Massage gently for 1–2 minutes, then rinse thoroughly. AVOID EYES. Can be used in the morning if using tretinoin at night.</td><td>Expect initial dryness and redness – improves with continued use. Will bleach towels, pillowcases, and clothing. RINSE THOROUGHLY. If severe irritation occurs, reduce frequency or discontinue. DO NOT apply at the same time as standard tretinoin.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CLINDAMYCIN</strong> (1%)<br>Prescription</td><td>Reduces acne-causing bacteria, decreases inflammation; effective for inflammatory acne (red bumps and pimples)</td><td>Wash and dry face completely before applying. Apply a thin film to the entire affected area once or twice daily.</td><td>Do not use as monotherapy (always combine with benzoyl peroxide).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>TRETINOIN</strong> (0.025%, 0.05%, 0.1%)<br>Prescription<br><strong>ADAPALENE 0.1% GEL</strong> (Differin)<br>OTC (0.1%); Prescription (0.3%)<br><em>Cornerstone of acne treatment—Considered first-line!</em></td><td>Unclogs pores and prevents new comedones (comedolytic), reduces inflammation; speeds up skin cell turnover to clear existing acne; improves dark spots from acne (postinflammatory hyperpigmentation). Tretinoin provides significant long-term benefits beyond acne treatment, including restoration of collagen synthesis, improvement in photoaging, pigmentation from scarring, and maintenance of skin health.</td><td>Wash face with a gentle cleanser and pat dry completely. Wait 20–30 minutes after washing before applying (skin should be completely dry). Apply a pea-sized amount to the ENTIRE face once daily at bedtime—not just on pimples. Spread in a thin layer, avoiding eyes, mouth, corners of nose, and lips. Start slowly: use every 2–3 nights for the first 2 weeks, then increase to every other night, then nightly as tolerated. Apply moisturizer BEFORE/AFTER/BOTH (Sandwich method). Wait 5–10 minutes.</td><td>Expect dryness, peeling, redness, and stinging—normal and usually peaks at 2 weeks, then improves. \"Purging\" may occur: acne may temporarily worsen for 4–6 weeks as hidden pimples come to the surface—this is NOT a reason to stop. Increases sun sensitivity—wear SPF 30+ sunscreen daily! Tretinoin breaks down in sunlight (photolabile)—apply only at night. DO NOT apply at the same time as benzoyl peroxide (inactivates standard tretinoin)—use BP in the morning, tretinoin at night. Avoid during pregnancy due to potential teratogenic risk.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>SALICYLIC ACID</strong> (0.5–2%)<br>OTC: wash, gel, pad, or cream</td><td>Unclogs pores (comedolytic); helps remove dead skin cells; helps penetrate oil-filled pores; anti-inflammatory properties</td><td>Apply once or twice daily to affected areas. Start with lower concentrations if you have sensitive skin.</td><td>May cause mild irritation, dryness, or peeling.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GLYCOLIC ACID</strong> (Alpha-Hydroxy Acid)<br>OTC: 5–10%</td><td>Exfoliates dead skin cells; unclogs pores; improves skin texture / brightness</td><td>Start with lower concentrations (5–8%) and use every other day. Apply to clean, dry skin in the evening. Always use sunscreen during the day.</td><td>May cause stinging, redness, or peeling. Avoid combining with other strong acids or retinoids initially. Use cautiously in sensitive skin.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>AZELAIC ACID</strong> (15–20%)<br>Prescription and OTC</td><td>Unclogs pores (comedolytic); antimicrobial activity; anti-inflammatory effects; lightens dark spots from acne; considered safe for pregnancy</td><td>Apply a thin layer to affected areas once or twice daily (morning and/or evening).</td><td>May cause temporary burning, stinging, or tingling.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>SULFUR WASH</strong> (typically combo w/ sodium sulfacetamide 10%/sulfur 5%)<br>Prescription and OTC</td><td>Antibacterial + antifungal properties; keratolytic (helps shed dead skin); anti-inflammatory effects; useful for acne, rosacea, and seborrheic dermatitis</td><td>Apply to wet skin and massage gently. Leave on for 1–2 minutes, then rinse. Use once or twice daily as directed.</td><td>Has a distinctive sulfur smell (newer formulations minimize this). May cause mild dryness or irritation. Avoid using with benzoyl peroxide (causes orange-brown staining).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>NIACINAMIDE</strong> (2–5%)<br>OTC</td><td>Anti-inflammatory effects; regulates sebum (oil) production; strengthens skin barrier; lightens dark spots from acne</td><td>Apply to clean skin once or twice daily. Can be used morning and/or evening.</td><td>Mild irritation in sensitive individuals.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CICAPLAST BAUME B5+ / CERAMIDE MOISTURIZERS</strong></td><td>Soothes and repairs irritated skin; restores skin barrier damaged by acne treatments</td><td>Apply a thin layer morning and/or evening. Can be used over acne treatments to reduce irritation. Use morning and/or evening.</td><td>Not an acne treatment itself—use as supportive care. Choose non-comedogenic formulations.</td></tr></tbody></table>"
